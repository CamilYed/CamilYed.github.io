Hello! I’m Kamil Jędrzejuk, a software engineer who thrives on being intimately involved with the projects I work on.
I am deeply interested in exploring software architecture that seamlessly aligns with the diverse business requirements 
of every corporation.

In my current professional career, I've had the opportunity to work with a range of companies, from small firms to 
corporations, across various industries such as e-commerce, fintech, and HR management. 

Privately, I am a boxing enthusiast, finding inspiration in the discipline, strategy, and resilience inherent to the sport. 
Additionally, I have a keen interest in geopolitics, fascinated by the complex interplay of factors shaping global affairs 
and their impact on socio-economic dynamics.
